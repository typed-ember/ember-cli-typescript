# Configuration

## Blueprints

By default, ember-cli-typescript installs the [ember-cli-typescript-blueprints](https://github.com/typed-ember/ember-cli-typescript-blueprints) package so that you can use Ember's generators like normal, but with all the special sauce you need for things to work nicely throughout your system with TypeScript.

If you want to stick with the normal JavaScript blueprints—say, because your team isn't ready to dive into the deep end with making _everything_ TypeScript yet—you can simply uninstall the blueprints package.

With yarn:

```bash
yarn remove ember-cli-typescript-blueprints
```

With npm:

```bash
npm uninstall ember-cli-typescript-blueprints
```

## `tsconfig.json`

We generate a good default [`tsconfig.json`][tsconfig-blueprint], which will usually make everything _Just Work™_. In general, you may customize your TypeScript build process as usual using the `tsconfig.json` file.

However, there are a few things worth noting if you're already familiar with TypeScript and looking to make further or more advanced customizations (but _most_ users can just ignore this section!):

1. The generated tsconfig file does not set `"outDir"` and sets `"noEmit"` to `true`. The default configuration we generate allows you to run editors which use the compiler without creating extraneous `.js` files throughout your codebase, leaving the compilation to ember-cli-typescript to manage.

   You _can_ still customize those properties in `tsconfig.json` if your use case requires it, however. For example, to see the output of the compilation in a separate folder you are welcome to set `"outDir"` to some path and set `"noEmit"` to `false`. Then tools which use the TypeScript compiler (e.g. the watcher tooling in JetBrains IDEs) will generate files at that location, while the Ember.js/[Broccoli](https://broccoli.build) pipeline will continue to use its own temp folder.

2. Closely related to the previous point: any changes you do make to `outDir` won't have any effect on how _Ember_ builds your application—we run the entire build pipeline through Babel's TypeScript support instead of through the TypeScript compiler.
3. Since your application is built by Babel, and only _type-checked_ by TypeScript, we set the `target` key in `tsconfig.json` to the current version of the ECMAScript standard so that type-checking uses the latest and greatest from the JavaScript standard library. The Babel configuration in your app's `config/targets.js` and any included polyfills will determine the final build output.
4. If you make changes to the paths included in or excluded from the build via your `tsconfig.json` (using the `"include"`, `"exclude"`, or `"files"` keys), you will need to restart the server to take the changes into account: ember-cli-typescript does not currently watch the `tsconfig.json` file. For more details, see [the TypeScript reference materials for `tsconfig.json`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html).

## Enabling Sourcemaps

To enable TypeScript sourcemaps, you'll need to add the corresponding configuration for Babel to your `ember-cli-build.js` file:

```typescript
const app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
  babel: {
    sourceMaps: 'inline',
  },
});
```

(Note that this _will_ noticeably slow down your app rebuilds.)

If you're updating from an older version of the addon, you may also need to update your `tsconfig.json`. (Current versions generate the correct config at installation.) Either run `ember generate ember-cli-typescript` or verify you have the same sourcemap settings in your `tscsonfig.json` that appear in [the blueprint][tsconfig-blueprint].
