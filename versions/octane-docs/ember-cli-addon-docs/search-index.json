Components","text":"Glimmer Components If you’re entirely unfamiliar with Glimmer components, we recommend the Ember Guides to understand that first! Throughout this guide, we’ll link back to the main Ember Guide when there are specific concepts that we will not explain here but which are important for understanding what we’re covering! Glimmer Components are defined in one of three ways: with templates only, with a template and a backing class, or with only a backing class (i.e. a yield-only component). When using a backing class, you get a first-class experience using TypeScript! Unfortunately, we don’t yet support type-checking for templates, but we hope to build that out eventually. Don’t let that stop you, though: types in your component classes make for a great experience, so let’s dig in and see how it works in practice. A simple component A very simple Glimmer component which lets you change the count of a value might look like this: <button {{on \"click\" this.minus}}>&minus;</button> {{this.count}} <button {{on \"click\" this.plus}}>+</button> import Component from '@glimmer/component'; import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking' import { action } from '@ember/object'; export default class Counter extends Component { @tracked count = 0; @action plus() { this.count += 1; } @action minus() { this.count -= 1; } } Notice that there are no type declarations here – but this is actually a well-typed component. The type of count is number, and if we accidentally wrote something like this.count = \"hello\" the compiler would give us an error. A component with arguments So far so good, but of course most components aren’t quite this simple! Instead, they’re invoked by other templates and they can invoke other components themselves in their own templates. Glimmer components can receive both arguments and attributes when they are invoked. When you are working with a component’s backing class, you have access to the arguments but not to the attributes. The arguments are passed to the constructor, and then available as this.args on the component instance afterward. Let’s imagine a component which just logs the names of its arguments when it is first constructed: import Component from '@glimmer/component'; export default class ArgsDisplay extends Component { constructor(owner: unknown, args: {}) { super(owner, args); Object.keys(args).forEach(argName => { console.log(argName); }); } } If you’re used to the classic Ember Object model, there are two important differences in the constructor itself: we use super instead of this._super we must call super before we do anything else Notice that we have to start by calling super with owner and args. This may be a bit different from what you’re used to in Ember or other frameworks, but is normal for sub-classes in TypeScript. If the compiler just accepted any ...arguments, a lot of potentially very unsafe invocations would go through. So, instead of using ...arguments, we explicitly pass the specific arguments and make sure their types match up with what the super-class expects. The types for owner here and args line up with what the constructor for Glimmer components expect. The owner is specified as unknown because this is a detail we explicitly don’t need to know about. The args are {} because a Glimmer component always receives an object containing its arguments, even if the caller didn’t pass anything: then it would just be an empty object. {} is an empty object type – all objects extend from it, but there will be no properties on it. This is distinct from the object type, which the TypeScript docs describe as: any thing that is not number, string, boolean, symbol, null, or undefined. If we used object, we could end up with TypeScript thinking args were an array, or a Set, or anything else that isn’t a primitive. Since we have {}, we . For some further details, check out this blog post. The args passed to a Glimmer Component are available on this, so we could change our definition to return the names of the arguments from a getter: import Component from '@glimmer/component'; export default class ArgsDisplay extends Component { get argNames(): string[] { return Object.keys(this.args); } } <ul> {{#each this.argNames as |argName|}} <li>{{argName}}</li> {{/each}} </ul> Now, looking at that bit of code, you might be wondering how it knows what the type of this.args is. In the constructor version, we explicitly named the type of the args argument. Here, it seems to just work automatically. This works because the type definition for a Glimmer component looks roughly like this: class Component<Args extends {} = {}> { args: Args; constructor(owner: unknown, args: Args); } ::TODO: pull in the content from my answer on Stack Overflow here!::","route":"docs.guide.components","keywords":[]},"template:docs/guide/controllers":{"id":"template:docs/guide/controllers","type":"template","title":"Controllers","text":"Controllers","route":"docs.guide.controllers","keywords":[]},"template:docs/guide/helpers":{"id":"template:docs/guide/helpers","type":"template","title":"Helpers","text":"Helpers","route":"docs.guide.helpers","keywords":[]},"template:docs/guide/overview":{"id":"template:docs/guide/overview","type":"template","title":"Overview","text":"Overview","route":"docs.guide.overview","keywords":[]},"template:docs/guide/routes":{"id":"template:docs/guide/routes","type":"template","title":"Routes","text":"Routes","route":"docs.guide.routes","keywords":[]},"template:docs/guide/services":{"id":"template:docs/guide/services","type":"template","title":"Services","text":"Services","route":"docs.guide.services","keywords":[]},"template:docs/guide/testing":{"id":"template:docs/guide/testing","type":"template","title":"Testing","text":"Testing Testing with TypeScript mostly works just the same as you'd expect in a non-TypeScript Ember application—so if you're just starting out with Ember, we recommend you read the official Ember Testing Guides first. The rest of this guide assumes you're already comfortable with testing in Ember! When working with TypeScript in Ember tests, there are a few differences in your experience, and there are Differences App tests One major difference when working with TypeScript in app code is that once your app is fully converted, there are a bunch of kinds of tests you just don't need to write any more: things like testing bad inputs to functions. We'll use an admittedly silly and contrived example here, an add function to add two numbers together, so that we can focus on the differences between JavaScript and TypeScript, rather than getting hung up on the details of this particular function. First, the function we're testing might look like this. Here we’re using the assert from @ember/debug. If you’re not familiar with it, you might want to take a look at its API docs! It’s a development-and-test-only helper that gets stripped from production builds, and is very helpful for this kind of thing! // app/utils/math.js export function add(a, b) { assert( 'arguments must be numbers', typeof a === number && typeof b === number ); return a + b; } Then the test for it might look something like this: // tests/unit/utils/math-test.js import { module, test } from 'qunit'; import { add } from 'app/utils/math'; module('the `add` function', function(hooks) { test('adds numbers correctly', function(assert) { assert.equal('2 + 2 is 4', add(2, 2), 4); assert.notEqual('2 + 2 is a number', add(2, 2), NaN); assert.notEqual('2 + 2 is not infinity', add(2, 2), Infinity); }); test('throws an error with strings', function(assert) { assert.throws( 'when the first is a string and the second is a number', () => add('hello', 1) ); assert.throws( 'when the first is a number and the second is a string', () => add(0, 'hello') ); assert.throws( 'when both are strings', () => add('hello', 'goodbye') ); }) }); In TypeScript, that wouldn't make any sense at all, because we'd simply add the types to the function declaration: // app/utils/math.ts export function add(a: number, b: number): number { assert( 'arguments must be numbers', typeof a === number && typeof b === number ); return a + b; } We might still write tests to make sure what we actually got back was what we expected— // tests/unit/utils/math-test.ts import { module, test } from 'qunit'; import { add } from 'app/utils/math'; module('the `add` function', function(hooks) { test('adds numbers correctly', function(assert) { assert.equal('2 + 2 is 4', add(2, 2), 4); assert.notEqual('2 + 2 is a number', add(2, 2), NaN); assert.notEqual('2 + 2 is not infinity', add(2, 2), Infinity); }); }); —but there are a bunch of things we don't need to test. All of those special bits of handling for the case where we pass in a string or undefined or whatever else? We can drop that. Notice, too, that we can drop the assertion from our function definition, because the compiler will check this for us: // app/utils/math.ts export function add(a: number, b: number): number { return a + b; } Addon tests Note, however, that this only applies to app code. If you're writing an Ember addon (or any other library), you cannot assume that everyone consuming your code is using TypeScript. You still need to account for these kinds of cases. This will require you to do something that probably feels a bit gross: casting a bunch of values as any for your tests, so that you can test what happens when people feed bad data to your addon! Let's return to our silly example with an add function. Our setup will look a lot like it did in the JavaScript-only example—but with some extra type coercions along the way so that we can invoke it the way JavaScript-only users might. First, notice that in this case we’ve added back in our assert in the body of the function. The inputs to our function here will get checked for us by any TypeScript users, but this way we are still doing the work of helping out our JavaScript users. function add(a: number, b: number): number { assert( 'arguments must be numbers', typeof a === number && typeof b === number ); return a + b; } Now, back in our test file, we’re similarly back to testing all those extra scenarios, but here TypeScript would actually stop us from even having these tests work at all if we didn’t use the as operator to throw away what TypeScript knows about our code! // tests/unit/utils/math-test.js import { module, test } from 'qunit'; import { add } from 'app/utils/math'; module('the `add` function', function(hooks) { test('adds numbers correctly', function(assert) { assert.equal('2 + 2 is 4', add(2, 2), 4); assert.notEqual('2 + 2 is a number', add(2, 2), NaN); assert.notEqual('2 + 2 is not infinity', add(2, 2), Infinity); }); test('throws an error with strings', function(assert) { assert.throws( 'when the first is a string and the second is a number', () => add('hello' as any, 1) ); assert.throws( 'when the first is a number and the second is a string', () => add(0, 'hello' as any) ); assert.throws( 'when both are strings', () => add('hello' as any, 'goodbye' as any) ); }) }); Gotchas The TestContext A common scenario in Ember tests, especially integration tests, is setting some value on the this context of the tests, so that it can be used in the context of the test. For example, we might need to set up a User type to pass into a Profile component. We’re going to start by defining a basic User and Profile so that we have a good idea of what we’re testing. The User type is very simple, just an interface: // app/types/user.ts export default interface User { displayName: string; avatarUrl?: string; } Then our component might be defined like this: {{! app/components/profile.hbs }} <div class='user-profile' ...attributes> <img src={{this.avatar}} alt={{this.description}} class='avatar' data-test-avatar /> <span class='name' data-test-name>{{@displayName}}</span> </div> import Component from '@glimmer/component'; import User from 'app/types/user'; import { randomAvatarURL } from 'app/utils/avatar'; export default class Profile extends Component<User> { get avatar() { return this.args.avatar ?? randomAvatarURL(); } get description() { return this.args.avatar ? `${this.args.displayName}'s custom profile picture` : 'a randomly generated placeholder avatar'; } } <aside> Not familiar with how we define a Glimmer `Component` and its arguments? Check out [our guide][glimmer-component]! </aside> Now, with that setup out of the way, let’s get back to talking about the text context! We need to set up a `User` to pass into the test. With TypeScript on our side, we can even make sure that it actually matches up to the type we want to use! import { module, test } from 'qunit'; import { setupRenderingTest } from 'ember-qunit'; import { render } from '@ember/test-helpers'; import hbs from 'htmlbars-inline-precompile'; import User from 'app/types/user'; module('Integration | Component | Profile', function(hooks) { setupRenderingTest(hooks); test('given a user with an avatar', async function(assert) { this.user: User = { displayName: 'Rey', avatar: 'https://example.com/star-wars/rey', }; await render(hbs`<Profile @user={{this.user}}`); assert.dom('[data-test-name]').hasText(this.user.displayName); assert.dom('[data-test-avatar]') .hasAttribute('src', this.user.avatar); assert.dom('[data-test-avatar]') .hasAttribute('alt', `${this.user.displayName}'s custom profile picture`); }); test('given a user without an avatar', async function(assert) { this.user: User = { displayName: 'Rey', }; await render(hbs`<Profile @user={{this.user}}`); assert.dom('[data-test-name]').hasText(this.user.displayName); assert.dom('[data-test-avatar]') .hasAttribute('src', /rando-avatars-yo/); assert.dom('[data-test-avatar]') .hasAttribute('alt', 'a randomly generated placeholder avatar'); }); }); This is a decent test, and TypeScript actually makes the experience of writing certain parts of it pretty nice. Unfortunately, though, it won’t type-check. TypeScript reports: <!-- TODO: the actual error message about `TestContext` --> TypeScript *does* know that QUnit sets up a test context—helpfully named `TestContext`—so a lot of the things we can do in tests work out of the box—but we haven’t told TypeScript that `this` now has a `user` property on it. To inform TypeScript about this, we need to tell it that the type of `this` in each test assertion includes the `user` property, of type `User`. We’ll start by importing the `TestContext` defined by Ember’s test helpers, and extending it: import { TestContext } from 'ember-test-helpers'; import User from 'app/types/user'; interface Context extends TestContext { user: User; } Then, in every `test` callback, we need to [specify the `this` type][this-type]: test('...', function(this: Context, assert) { }); [this-type]: TODO -- link to docs Putting it all together, this is what our updated test definition would look like: import { module, test } from 'qunit'; import { setupRenderingTest } from 'ember-qunit'; import { render } from '@ember/test-helpers'; import hbs from 'htmlbars-inline-precompile'; import { TestContext } from 'ember-test-helpers'; import User from 'app/types/user'; interface Context extends TestContext { user: User; } module('Integration | Component | Profile', function(hooks) { setupRenderingTest(hooks); test('given a user with an avatar', async function(this: Context, assert) { this.user: User = { displayName: 'Rey', avatar: 'https://example.com/star-wars/rey', }; await render(hbs`<Profile @user={{this.user}}`); assert.dom('[data-test-name]').hasText(this.user.displayName); assert.dom('[data-test-avatar]') .hasAttribute('src', this.user.avatar); assert.dom('[data-test-avatar]') .hasAttribute('alt', `${this.user.displayName}'s custom profile picture`); }); test('given a user without an avatar', async function(this: Context, assert) { this.user: User = { displayName: 'Rey', }; await render(hbs`<Profile @user={{this.user}}`); assert.dom('[data-test-name]').hasText(this.user.displayName); assert.dom('[data-test-avatar]') .hasAttribute('src', /rando-avatars-yo/); assert.dom('[data-test-avatar]') .hasAttribute('alt', 'a randomly generated placeholder avatar'); }); }); Now everything type-checks again, and we get the nice auto-completion we’re used to when dealing with `this.user` in the test body. <aside> If you’ve been around TypeScript a little, and you look up the type of the `TestContext` and realize its an interface, you might be tempted to reach for declaration merging here. Don’t! If you do that, *every single test in your entire application* will now have a `user: User` property on it! </aside> There are still a couple things to be careful about here, however. First, we didn’t specify that the `this.user` property was *optional*. That means that TypeScript won’t complain if you do `this.user` *before* assigning to it. Second, every test in our module gets the same `Context`. Depending on what you’re doing, that may be fine, but you may end up needing to define multiple distinct test context extensions. If you *do* end up needing to define a bunch of different test context extension, that may be a sign that this particular set of tests is doing too much. That in turn is probably a sign that this particular *component* is doing too much!","route":"docs.guide.testing","keywords":[]},"template:docs/index":{"id":"template:docs/index","type":"template","title":"Overview","text":"Overview This guide is designed to help you get up and running with TypeScript in an Ember app. To get started, check out the instructions in Getting Started.

However, many existing applications include parts of the pre-Octane (“legacy”) Ember programming model, and we support that model—with caveats. Mixins and classic class syntax The Ember mixin system is the legacy Ember construct TypeScript supports least well. While this may not be intuitively obvious, the classic class syntax simply is the mixin system. Every classic class creation is a case of mixing together multiple objects to create a new base class with a shared prototype. The result is that any time you see the classic .extend({ ... }) syntax, regardless of whether there is a named mixin involved, you are dealing with Ember's legacy mixin system. This in turn means that you are dealing with the parts of Ember which TypeScript is least able to handle well. While we describe here how to use types with classic (mixin-based) classes insofar as they do work, there are many failure modes. As a result, we strongly recommend moving away from both classic classes and mixins, and as quickly as possible. This is the direction the Ember ecosystem as a whole is moving, but it is especially important for TypeScript users. The Ember Atlas includes guides for migrating from classic classes to native classes, along with a variety of patterns for dealing with specific kinds of mixins in your codebase. Failure modes ::TODO: spell these out/include others:: need to define this in actions hashes, CPs, etc. …which leads to problems with self-referential this TS simply fails to resolve types when enough mixins are involved Zebra-striping problem: types stop resolving ::TODO: others? :: Native classes EmberObject In general, we recommend (following the Ember Octane guides) that any class which extends directly from the EmberObject base class eliminate any use of EmberObject-specific API and convert to standalone class, with no base class at all. You can follow the ember-classic-decorator workflow to eliminate the base class—switching from init to constructor, getting rid of uses of methods like this.set and this.get in favor of using standalone set and get, and so on. EmberObject-descended classes The framework base classes which depend on EmberObject cannot follow the exact same path. However, as long as you are using native class syntax, all of these (Component, Controller, Helper, etc.) work nicely and safely with TypeScript. In each of these cases, the same caveats apply as with EmberObject itself, and you should follow the ember-classic-decorator workflow with them as well if you are converting an existing app or addon. However, because these base classes themselves descend from EmberObject, you will not be able to remove the base classes as you can with your own classes which descend directly from EmberObject. Instead, you will continue to extend from the Ember base classes: import Component from '@ember/component'; export default class Profile extends Component {} import Controller from '@ember/controller'; export default class IndexController extends Controller {} import Helper from '@ember/component/helper'; export default class Localize extends Helper {} import Route from '@ember/routing/route'; export default class ApplicationRoute extends Route {} import EmberRouter from '@ember/routing/router' export default class AppRouter extends EmberRouter {} import Service from '@ember/service'; export default class Session extends Service {} import Model from '@ember-data/model'; export default class User extends Model {} Service Since Ember is largely, and increasingly, a “component-service framework”, you will find that you regularly need to specify the types of services you inject in other ","route":"docs.legacy.overview","keywords":[]},"template:docs/setup":{"id":"template:docs/setup","type":"template","title":"Installation","text":"Installation You can simply ember install the dependency like normal: ember install ember-cli-typescript@latest All dependencies will be added to your package.json, and you're ready to roll!

If you want to stick with the normal JavaScript blueprints—say, because your team isn't ready to dive into the deep end with making everything TypeScript yet—you can simply uninstall the blueprints package. With yarn: yarn remove ember-cli-typescript-blueprints With npm: npm uninstall ember-cli-typescript-blueprints tsconfig.json We generate a good default tsconfig.json, which will usually make everything Just Work™. In general, you may customize your TypeScript build process as usual using the tsconfig.json file. However, there are a few things worth noting if you're already familiar with TypeScript and looking to make further or more advanced customizations (but most users can just ignore this section!): The generated tsconfig file does not set \"outDir\" and sets \"noEmit\" to true. The default configuration we generate allows you to run editors which use the compiler without creating extraneous .js files throughout your codebase, leaving the compilation to ember-cli-typescript to manage. You can still customize those properties in tsconfig.json if your use case requires it, however. For example, to see the output of the compilation in a separate folder you are welcome to set \"outDir\" to some path and set \"noEmit\" to false. Then tools which use the TypeScript compiler (e.g. the watcher tooling in JetBrains IDEs) will generate files at that location, while the Ember.js/Broccoli pipeline will continue to use its own temp folder. Closely related to the previous point: any changes you do make to outDir won't have any effect on how Ember builds your application—we run the entire build pipeline through Babel's TypeScript support instead of through the TypeScript compiler. Since your application is built by Babel, and only type-checked by TypeScript, we set the target key in tsconfig.json to the current version of the ECMAScript standard so that type-checking uses the latest and greatest from the JavaScript standard library. The Babel configuration in your app's config/targets.js and any included polyfills will determine the final build output. If you make changes to the paths included in or excluded from the build via your tsconfig.json (using the \"include\", \"exclude\", or \"files\" keys), you will need to restart the server to take the changes into account: ember-cli-typescript does not currently watch the tsconfig.json file. For more details, see the TypeScript reference materials for tsconfig.json. Enabling Sourcemaps To enable TypeScript sourcemaps, you'll need to add the corresponding configuration for Babel to your ember-cli-build.js file: const app = new EmberApp(defaults, { babel: { sourceMaps: 'inline', }, }); (Note that this will noticeably slow down your app rebuilds.) If you're updating from an older version of the addon, you may also need to update your tsconfig.json. (Current versions generate the correct config at installation.)

Found 2 errors. error Command failed with exit code 1. This occurs whenever your yarn.lock or package-lock.json files include more than a single copy of a given set of type definitions—here, types for @ember/object, named @types/ember__object. See below for details on the yarn behavior, and Understanding the Package Names for details on the package names. Workarounds There are currently two recommended workarounds for this: You can specify a specific version of the package to use in the \"resolutions\" key in package.json. For example, if you saw that you had @types/ember__object@3.0.8 from the default package installs but @types/ember__object@3.0.5 from some-cool-ts-addon, you could force yarn to use 3.0.8 like so: { \"resolutions\": { \"@types/ember__object\": \"3.0.8\" } } You can identify the dependencies which installed the type dependencies transitively, and uninstall and reinstall them. For example, if running yarn why reported you had one version of @types/ember__object from the normally-installed set of packages, and one from some-cool-ts-addon, you could run this: yarn remove @types/ember some-cool-ts-addon yarn add -D @types/ember some-cool-ts-addon Understanding the Problem When you are using TypeScript in your Ember application, you consume Ember's types through DefinitelyTyped, the tool the TypeScript team built to power the @types/* definitions. That tooling examines the dependencies implied by the package imports and generates a package.json with those types specified with a * dependency version. On initial installation of your dependencies, yarn installs the highest version of the package available, and correctly deduplicates that across both your own package and all the @types packages which reference each other. However, later installs may introduce conflicting versions of the types, simply by way of yarn's normal update rules. TypeScript requires that there be one and only one type definition a given item can resolve to. Yarn actively avoids changing a previously-installed version of a transitive dependency when a newly installed package depends on the same dependency transitively. Thus, if one of your dependencies also depends on the same package from @types/* that you do, and you upgrade your dependence on that type by editing your package.json file and running yarn again, TypeScript will suddenly start offering the error described in detail above: Duplicate identifier 'EmberObject'.ts(2300) Normally, running yarn upgrade @types/ember__object instead of updating your package.json file will resolve this for you, because yarn will deduplicate the packages once again. ::TODO: confirm this is accurate!:: Let's imagine three packages, A, B, and C, where A is your app or library, and B and C have the following versions and dependencies: C is currently at version 1.2.3. B is at version 4.5.6. It depends on C with a * dependency. So the dependencies key in its package.json looks like this: { \"dependencies\": { \"C\": \"*\" } } Now, you install only B (this is the equivalent of installing just the basic type definitions in your package): { \"dependencies\": { \"B\": \"~4.5.6\" } } The first time you install these, you will get a single version of C – 1.2.3. Now, let's say that C publishes a new version, 1.2.4, and A (your app or library) adds a dependency on both C like so: { \"dependencies\": { \"B\": \"~4.5.6\", \"C\": \"~1.2.0\" } } When yarn runs, it goes out of its way to leave the existing installation of C in place, while adding a new version for you as a top-level consumer. So now you have two versions of C installed in your node_modules directory: 1.2.3 (for B) and 1.2.4 (for A, your app or library). What's important to understand here is that this is exactly the behavior you want as the default in the Node ecosystem. Automatically updating a transitive dependency—even when the change is simply a bug fix release—can cause your entire app or library to stop working. If one of your dependencies accidentally depended on that buggy behavior, and adding a direct dependency on the fixed version caused the buggy version to be upgraded, you're just out of luck. Yarn accounts for this by resolving packages to the same version during initial installation, but leaving existing package resolutions as they are when adding new dependencies later. Unfortunately, this is also the opposite of what you want for TypeScript, which needs a single source of truth for the types in your app or library. When you install the type definitions, and then later install a package which transitively depends on those type definitions Understanding the Workarounds The two solutions listed above both make sure Yarn only installs a single version of the package. Specifying a version in the \"resolutions\" field in your package.json simply forces Yarn to resolve every reference to that package to a single version. This actually works extremely well for types, but it means that every time you either update the types package(s) yourself or update a package which transitively depends on them, you have to edit this value manually as well. Uninstalling and reinstalling both the impacted packages and all the packages which transitively depend on them gives you the same behavior as an initial install… because that's exactly what you're doing. The downside, of course, is that you have to identify and uninstall and reinstall all top-level packages which transitively depend on the files, and this introduces risk by way of other transitive dependencies being updated.

Some imports don't resolve You'll frequently see errors for imports which TypeScript doesn't know how to resolve. For example, if you use Ember Concurrency today and try to import its task helper: import { task } from 'ember-concurrency'; You'll see an error, because there aren't yet type definitions for it.

We would also love to hear your stories! Some specific tips for success on the technical front: Use the strictest strictness settings that our typings allow. While it may be tempting to start with the loosest strictness settings and then to tighten them down as you go, this will actually mean that \"getting your app type-checking\" will become a repeated process – getting it type-checking with every new strictness setting you enable! – rather than something you do just once. The only strictness setting you should turn off is strictFunctionTypes, which our current type definitions do not support. The recommended strictness settings in your \"compilerOptions\" hash: \"noImplicitAny\": true, \"noImplicitThis\": true, \"alwaysStrict\": true, \"strictNullChecks\": true, \"strictPropertyInitialization\": true, \"noFallthroughCasesInSwitch\": true, \"noUnusedLocals\": true, \"noUnusedParameters\": true, \"noImplicitReturns\": true, A good approach is to start at your \"leaf\" files (the ones that don't import anything else from your app, only Ember types) and then work your way back inward toward the most core types that are used everywhere. Often the highest-value modules are your Ember Data models and any core services that are used everywhere else in the app – and those are also the ones that tend to have the most cascading effects (having to update tons of other places in your app) when you type them later in the process. Set \"noEmitOnError\": true in the \"compilerOptions\" hash in your tsconfig.json – it will help a lot if you can be sure that for the parts of your app you have added types to are still correct. And you'll get nice feedback immediately when you have type errors that way! There are two schools of thought on how to handle things you don't have types for as you go: Liberally use any for them and come back and fill them in later. This will let you do the strictest strictness settings but with an escape hatch that lets you say \"We will come back to this when we have more idea how to handle it.\" Go more slowly, but write down at least minimally accurate types as you go. (This is easier if you follow the leaves-first strategy recommended above.) This is much harder, but allows you to have much higher confidence as you work through the app. There is an inherent tradeoff between these two approaches; which works best will depend on your team and your app. You may find the blog series \"Typing Your Ember\" helpful as it walks you through not only how to install but how to most effectively use TypeScript in an Ember app today, and gives some important info on the background and roadmap for the project. Install other types! You'll want to use other type definitions as much as possible. The first thing you should do, for example, is install the types for your testing framework of choice: @types/ember-mocha or @types/ember-qunit. Beyond that, look for types from other addons: it will mean writing any a lot less and getting a lot more help both from your editor and from the compiler. Where can I find types? Some addons will ship them with their packages, and work out of the box. For others, you can search for them on Definitely Typed, or on npm under the @types namespace. (In the future we hope to maintain a list of known types; keep your eyes open!) The types directory During installation, we create a types directory in the root of your application and add a \"paths\" mapping that includes that directory in any type lookups TypeScript tries to do. This is convenient for a few things: global types for your package (see the next section) writing types for third-party/vendor packages which do not have any types developing types for an addon which you intend to upstream later These are all fallbacks, of course, you should use the types supplied directly with a package Global types for your package At the root of your application or addon, we include a types/<your app> directory with an index.d.ts file in it. Anything which is part of your application but which must be declared globally can go in this file. For example, if you have data attached to the Window object when the page is loaded (for bootstrapping or whatever other reason), this is a good place to declare it. In the case of applications (but not for addons), we also automatically include declarations for Ember's prototype extensions in this index.d.ts file, with the Array prototype extensions enabled and the Function prototype extensions commented out. You should configure them to match your own config (which we cannot check during installation). If you are disabling Ember's prototype extensions, you can remove these declarations entirely; we include them because they're enabled in most Ember applications today. Environment configuration typings Along with the @types/ files mentioned above, ember-cli-typescript adds a starter interface for config/environment.js in app/config/environment.d.ts. This interface will likely require some changes to match your app. We install this file because the actual config/environment.js is (a) not actually identical with the types as you inherit them in the content of an application, but rather a superset of what an application has access to, and (b) not in a the same location as the path at which you look it up. The actual config/environment.js file executes in Node during the build, and Ember CLI writes its result as <my-app>/config/environment into your build for consumption at runtime. String-keyed lookups Ember makes heavy use of string-based APIs to allow for a high degree of dynamicism. With some limitations, you can nonetheless use TypeScript very effectively to get auto-complete/IntelliSense as well as to accurately type-check your applications. The \"Update\" sequence in the Typing Your Ember has detailed explanations and guides for getting good type-safety for Ember's string-based APIs, e.g. the use of get and set, service and controller injection, Ember Data models and lookups Part 1: A look at normal Ember objects, \"arguments\" to components (and controllers), and service (or controller) injections. Part 2: Class properties — some notes on how things differ from the Ember.Object world. Part 3: Computed properties, actions, mixins, and class methods. Part 4: Using Ember Data, and service and controller injections improvements. (This includes a detailed guide to updating making the service and controller injections and Ember Data lookups behave as described below.) A few of the most common speed-bumps are listed here to help make this easier: this type workaround One important note for using class types effectively with today's Ember typings: you will (at least for now) need to explicitly write out a this type for methods, computed property callbacks, and actions if you are going to use get or set import Component from '@ember/component'; export default class UserProfile extends Component { changeUsername(this: UserProfile, userName: string) { // ^---------------^ // `this` tells TS to use `UserProfile` for `get` and `set` lookups } } This is a workaround for how incredibly dynamic Ember.Object instances are and hopefully will improve over time as we continue to iterate on the type definitions. Again, see the relevant blog post for details. Nested keys in get or set In general, this.get and this.set will work as you'd expect if you're doing lookups only a single layer deep. Things like this.get('a.b.c') don't (and can't ever!) type-check; see the blog posts for a more detailed discussion of why. The workaround is simply to do one of two things: The type-safe approach. This will typecheck, but is both ugly and only works *if there are no nulls or undefineds along the way. If nested is null at runtime, this will crash! import { get } from '@ember/object'; // -- Type-safe but ugly --// get(get(get(someObject, 'deeply'), 'nested'), 'key'); Using // @ts-ignore. This will not do any type-checking, but is useful for the cases where you are intentionally checking a path which may be null or undefined anywhere long it. // @ts-ignore get(someObject, 'deeply.nested.key'); It's usually best to include an explanation of why you're ignoring a lookup! Service and controller injections Ember does service and controller lookups with the inject functions at runtime, using the name of the service or controller being injected up as the default value—a clever bit of metaprogramming that makes for a nice developer experience. TypeScript cannot do this, because the name of the service or controller to inject isn't available at compile time in the same way. The officially supported method for injections with TypeScript uses decorators, from the ember-decorators package (and soon in Ember itself). // my-app/services/my-session.ts import Service from '@ember/service'; import RSVP from 'rsvp'; export default class MySession extends Service { login(email: string, password: string): RSVP.Promise<string> { // login and return the confirmation message } } declare module '@ember/service' { interface Registry { 'my-session': MySession; } } Then we can use the service as we usually would with a decorator, but adding a type annotation to it so TypeScript knows what it's looking at: // my-app/components/user-profile.ts import Component from '@ember/component'; import { service } from '@ember-decorators/service'; import MySession from 'my-app/services/my-session'; export default class UserProfile extends Component { @service mySession!: MySession; login(email: string, password: string) { this.session.login(email, password); } } Note that we need the MySession type annotation this way, but we don't need the string lookup (unless we're giving the service a different name than the usual on the class, as in Ember injections in general). Without the type annotation, the type of session would just be any. This is because decorators are not allowed to modify the types of whatever they decorate. As a result, we wouldn't get any type-checking on that session.login call, and we wouldn't get any auto-completion either. Which would be really sad and take away a lot of the reason we're using TypeScript in the first place! Also notice the ! non-null assertion operator, which is required to prevent TS2564, that is caused by enabling strictPropertyInitialization in tsconfig.json. This also holds true for all other macros of the ember-decorators addon. Earlier Ember versions A couple notes for consumers on earlier Ember versions: On Ember versions earlier than 3.1, you'll want to wrap your service type in ComputedProperty, because native ES5 getters are not available there, which means that instead of accessing the service via this.mySession, you would have to access it as this.get('mySession') or get(this, 'mySession'). On Ember versions earlier than 3.6, you may encounter problems when providing type definitions like this: import Component from '@ember/component'; export default class UserProfile extends Component { username?: string; } When invoked via a template {{user-profile username='example123'}}, you would expect that username would have the value of example123, however prior to the native class feature released in Ember 3.6, this will result in username being undefined. For users who remain on Ember versions below 3.6, please use https://github.com/pzuraq/ember-native-class-polyfill Ember Data lookups We use the same basic approach for Ember Data type lookups with string keys as we do for service or controller injections. As a result, once you add the module and interface definitions for each model, serializer, and adapter in your app, you will automatically get type-checking and autocompletion and the correct return types for functions like findRecord, queryRecord, adapterFor, serializerFor, etc. No need to try to write out those (admittedly kind of hairy!) types; just write your Ember Data calls like normal and everything should just work. The declarations and changes you need to add to your existing files are: Models import DS from 'ember-data'; export default class UserMeta extends DS.Model.extend({ // attribute declarations here, as usual }) {} declare module 'ember-data/types/registries/model' { export default interface ModelRegistry { 'user-meta': UserMeta; } } Adapters import DS from 'ember-data'; export default class UserMeta extends DS.Adapter { // properties and methods } declare module 'ember-data/types/registries/adapter' { export default interface AdapterRegistry { 'user-meta': UserMeta; } } Serializers import DS from 'ember-data'; export default class UserMeta extends DS.Serializer { // properties and methods } declare module 'ember-data/types/registries/serializer' { export default interface SerializerRegistry { 'user-meta': UserMeta; } } Transforms import DS from 'ember-data'; export default class ColorTransform extends DS.Transform { // properties and methods } declare module 'ember-data/types/registries/transform' { export default interface TransformRegistry { color: ColorTransform; } } In addition to the registry, note the oddly defined class for DS.Models. This is because we need to set up the attribute bindings on the prototype (for a discussion of how and why this is different from class properties, see Typing Your Ember, Update, Part 2), but we cannot just use a const here because we need a named type—like a class!—to reference in the type registry and elsewhere in the app. Opt-in unsafety Also notice that unlike with service and controller injections, there is no unsafe fallback method by default, because there isn't an argument-less variant of the functions to use as there is for Service and Controller injection. If for some reason you want to opt out of the full type-safe lookup for the strings you pass into methods like findRecord, adapterFor, and serializerFor, you can add these declarations somewhere in your project: import DS from 'ember-data'; declare module 'ember-data/types/registries/model' { export default interface ModelRegistry { [key: string]: DS.Model; } } declare module 'ember-data/types/registries/adapter' { export default interface AdapterRegistry { [key: string]: DS.Adapter; } } declare module 'ember-data/types/registries/serializer' { export default interface SerializerRegistry { [key: string]: DS.Serializer; } } However, we strongly recommend that you simply take the time to add the few lines of declarations to each of your DS.Model, DS.Adapter, and DS.Serializer instances instead. It will save you time in even the short run! Fixing the Ember Data error TS2344 problem If you're developing an Ember app or addon and not using Ember Data (and accordingly not even have the Ember Data types installed), you may see an error like this and be confused: node_modules/@types/ember-data/index.d.ts(920,56): error TS2344: Type 'any' does not satisfy the constraint 'never'.This happens because the types for Ember's test tooling includes the types for Ember Data because the this value in several of Ember's test types can include a reference to DS.Store. The fix: add a declaration like this in a new file named ember-data.d.ts in your types directory: declare module 'ember-data/types/registries/model' { export default interface ModelRegistry { [key: string]: any; } } This works because (a) we include things in your types directory automatically and (b) TypeScript will merge this module and interface declaration with the main definitions for Ember Data from DefinitelyTyped behind the scenes. If you're developing an addon and concerned that this might affect consumers, it won't. Your types directory will never be referenced by consumers at all! Class property setup errors Some common stumbling blocks for people switching to ES6 classes from the traditional EmberObject setup: Assertion Failed: InjectedProperties should be defined with the inject computed property macros. – You've written someService = inject() in an ES6 class body in Ember 3.1+. Replace it with the .extend approach or by using decorators (@service or @controller) as discussed above. Because computed properties of all sorts, including injections, must be set up on a prototype, not on an instance, if you try to use class properties to set up injections, computed properties, the action hash, and so on, you will see this error. Assertion Failed: Attempting to lookup an injected property on an object without a container, ensure that the object was instantiated via a container. – You failed to pass ...arguments when you called super in e.g. a component class constructor. Always do super(...arguments), not just super(), in your constructor. Type definitions outside node_modules/@types By default, the TypeScript compiler loads all type definitions found in node_modules/@types. If the type defs you need are not found there and are not supplied in the root of the package you're referencing, you can register a custom value in paths in the tsconfig.json file. For example, if you're using ember-browserify, you're used to writing imports like this: import MyModule from 'npm:my-module'; If my-module has types, you will not be able to resolve them this way by default. You can add a simple tweak to your tsconfig.json to resolve the types correctly, however, mapping npm:* to node_modules/*. { \"compilerOptions\": { \"paths\": { \"my-app-name/*\": [\"app/*\"], \"npm:*\": [\"node_modules/*\"] } } } ember-cli-mirage Mirage adds files from a nonstandard location to your application tree, so you'll need to tell the TypeScript compiler about how that layout works. For an app, this should look roughly like: { \"compilerOptions\": { \"paths\": { // ... \"my-app-name/mirage/*\": \"mirage/*\", } }, \"include\": [ \"app\", \"tests\", \"mirage\" ] } And for an addon: { \"compilerOptions\": { \"paths\": { // ... \"dummy/mirage/*\": \"tests/dummy/mirage/*\", } }, \"include\": [ \"addon\", \"tests\" ] } Note that if Mirage was present when you installed ember-cli-typescript (or if you run ember g ember-cli-typescript), this configuration should be automatically set up for you. \"TypeScript is complaining about multiple copies of the same types!\" You may sometimes see TypeScript errors indicating that you have duplicate type definitions for Ember, Ember Data, etc. This is usually the result of an annoying quirk of the way both npm and yarn resolve your dependencies in their lockfiles. Just tell me how to fix it There are two options here, neither of them great: manually edit yarn.lock or package-lock.json and merge the conflicting add a \"resolutions\" key to your package.json with the version you want to install of the types you're installing: { \"resolutions\": { \"**/@types/ember\": \"2.8.15\" } } Why is this happening? If you're using another package which includes these types, and then you trigger an upgrade for your own copy of the type definitions, npm and yarn will both try to preserve the existing installation and simply add a new one for your updated version. In most cases, this is sane behavior, because it prevents transitive dependency breakage hell. However, in the specific case of type definitions, it causes TypeScript to get confused.","route":"docs.ts-guide.using-ts-effectively","keywords":[]},"template:docs/ts-guide/with-addons":{"id":"template:docs/ts-guide/with-addons","type":"template","title":"Building Addons in TypeScript","text":"Building Addons in TypeScript Building addons in TypeScript offers many of the same benefits as building apps that way: it puts an extra tool at your disposal to help document your code and ensure its correctness. For addons, though, there's one additional bonus: publishing type information for your addons enables autocomplete and inline documentation for your consumers, even if they're not using TypeScript themselves. Key Differences from Apps To process .ts files, ember-cli-typescript registers a set of Babel plugins so that Babel knows how to strip away TypeScript-specific syntax. This means that ember-cli-typescript operates according to the same set of rules as other preprocessors when used by other addons. Like other addons that preprocess source files, ember-cli-typescript must be in your addon's dependencies, not devDependencies. Because addons have no control over how files in app/ are transpiled, you cannot have .ts files in your addon's app/ folder. Publishing When you publish an addon written in TypeScript, the .ts files will be consumed and transpiled by Babel as part of building the host application the same way .js files are, in order to meet the requirements of the application's config/targets.js. This means that no special steps are required for your source code to be consumed by users of your addon. Even though you publish the source .ts files, though, by default you consumers who also use TypeScript won't be able to benefit from those types, because the TS compiler isn't aware of how ember-cli resolves import paths for addon files. For instance, if you write import { foo } from 'my-addon/bar';, the typechecker has no way to know that the actual file on disk for that import path is at my-addon/addon/bar.ts. In order for your addon's users to benefit from type information from your addon, you need to put .d.ts declaration files at the location on disk where the compiler expects to find them. This addon provides two commands to help with that: ember ts:precompile and ember ts:clean. The default ember-cli-typescript blueprint will configure your package.json to run these commands in the prepublishOnly and postpublish phases respectively, but you can also run them by hand to verify that the output looks as you expect. The ts:precompile command will populate the overall structure of your package with .d.ts files laid out to match their import paths. For example, addon/index.ts would produce an index.d.ts file in the root of your package. The ts:clean command will remove the generated .d.ts files, leaving your working directory back in a pristine state. The TypeScript compiler has very particular rules when generating declaration files to avoid letting private types leak out unintentionally. You may find it useful to run ember ts:precompile yourself as you're getting a feel for these rules to ensure everything will go smoothly when you publish. Linking Addons Often when developing an addon, it can be useful to run that addon in the context of some other host app so you can make sure it will integrate the way you expect, e.g. using yarn link or npm link. When you do this for a TypeScript addon, the source files will be picked up in the host app build and everything will execute at runtime as you'd expect. If the host app is also using TypeScript, though, it won't be able to resolve imports from your addon by default, for the reasons outlined above in the Publishing section. You could run ember ts:precompile in your addon any time you change a file, but for development a simpler option is to temporarily update the paths configuration in the host application so that it knows how to resolve types from your linked addon. Add entries for <addon-name> and <addon-name>/* in your tsconfig.json like so: compilerOptions: { // ...other options paths: { // ...other paths, e.g. for your app/ and tests/ trees // resolve: import x from 'my-addon'; \"my-addon\": [ \"node_modules/my-addon/addon\" ], // resolve: import y from 'my-addon/utils/y'; \"my-addon/*\": [ \"node_modules/my-addon/addon/*\" ] } } In-Repo Addons In-repo addons work in much the same way as linked ones. Their .ts files are managed automatically by ember-cli-typescript in their dependencies, and you can ensure imports resolve correctly from the host by adding entries in paths in the base tsconfig.json file. Note that the in-repo-addon blueprint should automatically add these entries if you have ember-cli-typescript-blueprints installed when you run it. compilerOptions: { // ...other options paths: { // ...other paths, e.g. for your tests/ tree \"my-app\": [ \"app/*\", // add addon app directory that will be merged with the host application \"lib/my-addon/app/*\" ], // resolve: import x from 'my-addon'; \"my-addon\": [ \"lib/my-addon/addon\" ], // resolve: import y from 'my-addon/utils/y'; \"my-addon/*\": [ \"lib/my-addon/addon/*\" ] } } One difference as compared to regular published addons: you know whether or not the host app is using ember-cli-typescript, and if it is, you can safely put .ts files in an in-repo addon's app/ folder.","route":"docs.ts-guide.with-addons","keywords":[]},"template:docs/type-defs/package-names":{"id":"template:docs/type-defs/package-names","type":"template","title":"Understanding the Package Names","text":"Understanding the Package Names You may be wondering why the packages added to your package.json and described in Installation: Other packages this addon installs are named things like @types/ember__object instead of something like @types/@ember/object.

Fix any problems introduced during the upgrade. Update ember-decorators. Fix any problems introduced during the upgrade. Update ember-cli-typescript. Follow the detailed upgrade guide below to fix discrepancies between Babel and TypeScript's compiled output. If you deviate from this order, you are likely to have a much more difficult time upgrading! Update ember-cli-babel ember-cli-typescript requires ember-cli-babel at version 7.1.0 or above, which requires ember-cli 2.13 or above. It also requires @babel/core 7.2.0 or higher. The recommended approach here is to deduplicate existing installations of the dependency, remove and reinstall ember-cli-babel to make sure that all its transitive dependencies are updated to the latest possible, and then to deduplicate again. If using yarn: npx yarn-deduplicate yarn remove ember-cli-babel yarn add --dev ember-cli-babel npx yarn-deduplicate If using npm: npm dedupe npm uninstall ember-cli-babel npm install --save-dev ember-cli-babel npm dedupe Note: If you are also using ember-decorators—and specifically the babel-transform that gets added with it—you will need update @ember-decorators/babel-transforms as well (anything over 3.1.0 should work): ember install ember-decorators@^3.1.0 @ember-decorators/babel-transforms@^3.1.0 Update ember-decorators Follow the same process of deduplication, reinstallation, and re-deduplication as described for ember-cli-babel above. This will get you the latest version of ember-decorators and, importantly, its @ember-decorators/babel-transforms dependency. Update ember-cli-typescript Now you can simply ember install the dependency like normal: ember install ember-cli-typescript@latest Note: To work properly, starting from v2, ember-cli-typescript must be declared as a dependency, not a devDependency for addons. With ember install this migration would be automatically handled for you. If you choose to make the upgrade manually with yarn or npm, here are the steps you need to follow: Remove ember-cli-typescript from your devDependencies. With yarn: yarn remove ember-cli-typescript With npm: npm uninstall ember-cli-typescript Install the latest of ember-cli-typescript as a dependency: With yarn: yarn add ember-cli-typescript@latest With npm: npm install --save ember-cli-typescript@latest Run ember generate: ember generate ember-cli-typescript Account for addon build pipeline changes Since we now integrate in a more traditional way into Ember CLI's build pipeline, there are two changes required for addons using TypeScript. Addons can no longer use .ts in app, because an addon's app directory gets merged with and uses the host's (i.e. the other addon or app's) preprocessors, and we cannot guarantee the host has TS support. Note that .ts will continue to work for in-repo addons because the app build works with the host's (i.e. the app's, not the addon's) preprocessors. Similarly, apps must use .js to override addon defaults in app, since the different file extension means apps no long consistently \"win\" over addon versions (a limitation of how Babel + app merging interact). Account for TS → Babel issues ember-cli-typescript v2 uses Babel to compile your code, and the TypeScript compiler only to check your code. This makes for much faster builds, and eliminates the differences between Babel and TypeScript in the build output that could cause problems in v1. However, because of those differences, you’ll need to make a few changes in the process of upgrading. Any place where a type annotation overrides a getter Fields like element, disabled, etc. as annotated defined on a subclass of Component and (correctly) not initialized to anything, e.g.: import Component from '@ember/component'; export default class Person extends Component { element!: HTMLImageElement; } This breaks because element is a getter on Component. This declaration then shadows the getter declaration on the base class and stomps it to undefined (effectively Object.defineProperty(this, 'element', void 0). Two solutions: Annotate locally (slightly more annoying, but less likely to troll you): class Image extends Component { useElement() { let element = this.element as HTMLImageElement; console.log(element.src); } } Use a local getter: class Image extends Component { // We do this because... get _element(): HTMLImageElement { return this.element as HTMLImageElement; } useElement() { console.log(this._element.src); } } const enum is not supported at all. You will need to replace all uses of const enum with simply enum or constants. Using ES5 getters or settings with this type annotations is not supported through at least Babel 7.3. However, they should also be unnecessary with ES6 classes, so you can simply remove the this type annotation. Trailing commas after rest function parameters (function foo(...bar[],) {}) are disallowed by the ECMAScript spec, so Babel also disallows them. Re-exports of types have to be disambiguated to be types, rather than values. Neither of these will work: export { FooType } from 'foo'; import { FooType } from 'foo'; export { FooType }; In both cases, Babel attempts to emit a value export, not just a type export, and fails because there is no actual value to emit. You can do this instead as a workaround: import * as Foo from 'foo'; export type FooType = Foo.FooType; ","route":"docs.upgrade-notes","keywords":[]},"template:index":{"id":"template:index","type":"template","title":null,"text":" Read the docs → ","route":"index","keywords":[]}}}
